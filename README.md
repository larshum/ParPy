# ParPy

ParPy is a Python library for GPU acceleration of Python code. Using ParPy, you annotate statements in a Python function, providing a high degree of control over how the code parallelizes on the GPU at the call site.

## Getting started

See the [installation](https://parpy-lib.github.io/installation) instructions on the ParPy website.

## Examples

The [ParPy documentation](https://parpy-lib.github.io/docs) contains tutorials walking through concrete examples of parallelization. In addition, the [test](/test) directory contains many programs using different aspects of parallelization available on ParPy.
